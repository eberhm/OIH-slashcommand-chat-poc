# Simple chat (realtime) with reactjs and websocket to test OIH

To test some workflows with OIH

This chant would be a slashcommand parser that would trigger OIH flows and receive the results of this flows in a callback that an ending component (not included here would call)

## Development

```bash

# install yarn (in directory)
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn start_client

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn start_server

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
